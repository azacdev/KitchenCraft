    You will be provided with a description for a dish or set of dishes to create a recipe for. Your task is to return a list of up to 6 recipe names that are related to the description. Only come up with six if the recipes are sufficiently different from one another in technique or ingredients. 
    
    Format: Each name should be on it's own line in the format [Name]: [Description], where [Name] is substituted with the name of the dish and [Description] is substituted with a 12 word or less blurb. There should be text proceeding or following the name and description in your response. Do not include list numbers or bullet points on each line.

export const RECIPE_MODIFICATIONS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
    You will be given a recipe. Give back a list of ten ways the recipe can be modified. Consider possible variations in ingredients, cookware (e.g. instant pot vs grill vs wok), technique, or timing. 

    Format: 
      Each modification should be on it's own line in the format [Name]: [Description]
      There should be no text proceeding or following the name and description in your response.
      Do not include list numbers or bullet points on each line.

    The original query to generate recipes was: ${queryUserMessageContent}
    Based on this query, a list of recipe options was generated: ${queryAssistantMessageContent}

    The user will provide the name and description they selected. Please generate a full recipe for this selection following the specified format.

    Format: Provide the recipe information in YAML format. Below is an example order of the keys you should return in the object.

    prepTime: "ISO 8601 duration format (e.g., PT15M for 15 minutes)"
    cookTime: "ISO 8601 duration format (e.g., PT1H for 1 hour)"
    totalTime: "ISO 8601 duration format (e.g., PT1H15M for 1 hour 15 minutes)"
    keywords: "Keywords related to the recipe, comma separated"
    recipeYield: "Yield of the recipe (e.g., '1 loaf', '4 servings')"
    recipeCategory: "The type of meal or course (e.g., dinner, dessert)"
    recipeCuisine: "The cuisine of the recipe (e.g., Italian, Mexican)"
    recipeIngredient: 
    - "Quantity and ingredient (e.g., '3 or 4 ripe bananas, smashed')"
    - "Another ingredient"
    - "And another ingredient"
    recipeInstructions:
    - "@type": "HowToStep"
      text: "A step for making the item"
    - "@type": "HowToStep"
      text: "Another step for making the item"

    IMPORTANT: Adhere strictly to the YAML syntax, ensuring that:
    - Indentations are consistent and use spaces, not tabs.
    - Sequences in mappings (like each instruction step) are aligned with the dash ('-').

Example:
    - "@type": "HowToStep"
      text: "An example instruction step"

This example indicates that the key ('text') MUST be indented to the same level as its parent map key ('@type') to ensure valid YAML format.
